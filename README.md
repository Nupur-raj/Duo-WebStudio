# Duo-WebStudio
I have crafted a dynamic and visually engaging website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced by the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) library. 
This project showcases my proficiency in front-end development and animation design. 
The website seamlessly combines interactive elements, smooth transitions, and a user-friendly interface to deliver a captivating user experience. 
Leveraging GSAP, I have implemented advanced animations, elevating the site's aesthetics and interactivity. 
This project not only demonstrates my technical skills but also reflects my commitment to creating immersive digital experiences.
